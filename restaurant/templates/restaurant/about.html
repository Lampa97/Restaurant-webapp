    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1" class="text-center display-5 text-warning fst-italic">Iron Hoof History</h4>
    <p class="text-center">Iron Hoof SteakHouse began in 1977 as a small, family-run venture — just a modest kitchen and
        a herd of cattle grazing on the hills behind the house. Nestled deep in the countryside, we started raising our
        own Angus and Hereford cattle, committed to quality from the very beginning.

        The name Iron Hoof was inspired by those early days. Our founder often said, “Every hoof that walks this farm
        carries the weight of our future.” The "iron" reflects the grit, resilience, and hard work poured into both the
        land and the kitchen — a name forged from the soul of our operation.

        What started as a simple countryside grill has grown into a modern steakhouse serving over 15,000 guests each
        year. We still raise our own cattle on over 200 acres of pasture, age our beef on-site for 21–28 days, and
        hand-cut each steak in-house.

        Today, Iron Hoof remains rooted in authenticity — bold flavors, farm-fresh meat, and a team that treats every
        plate like it’s part of something bigger: a legacy.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2" class="text-center display-5 text-warning fst-italic">Mission and Values</h4>
    <p class="text-center">At Iron Hoof SteakHouse, our mission is to serve unforgettable, farm-fresh beef with bold
        flavor and honest craftsmanship. From pasture to plate, we are committed to transparency, sustainability, and
        exceptional taste — creating an experience that brings people together around quality food and genuine
        hospitality.
        1. Farm First
        We believe the best flavor starts at the source. That’s why we raise our own cattle and hand-select every cut
        from our family farm just steps away from our kitchen.

        2. Craft Over Convenience
        Every steak we serve is trimmed, seasoned, and cooked with care — no shortcuts, no compromises. We honor the art
        of butchery and the skill of our chefs in everything we do.

        3. Taste With Integrity
        We’re transparent about where our food comes from and how it’s made. Locally raised, responsibly sourced, and
        always fresh — that’s our promise.

        4. Guest-Centered Hospitality
        Every plate is personal. Whether it’s your first visit or your fiftieth, we aim to deliver warm, attentive
        service that makes you feel right at home.

        5. Legacy & Innovation
        Rooted in tradition, driven by progress. We honor our 1977 roots while embracing new flavors, techniques, and
        ideas that elevate the steakhouse experience.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3" class="text-center display-5 text-warning fst-italic">Our team</h4>
    <p class="text-center">Meet the Team Behind the Flavor
        At Iron Hoof SteakHouse, we believe great food starts with great people. Our team is a tight-knit crew of chefs,
        farmers, butchers, and hospitality professionals — each one bringing passion, skill, and personality to the
        table.

        From the fields where our cattle are raised to the kitchen where our steaks are perfected, every member of the
        Iron Hoof family plays a vital role in delivering the experience you know and love.
